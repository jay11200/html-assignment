<p align="left"><b>Ans-</b>The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element.</p>

<p align="left">The most popular element selections in CSS (HTML) are ID and Class. The main difference between ID and Class is that one element on a page can be selected with the ID selector, however multiple elements can be selected by the class selector.</p>
<!--Question 8--> 

<h2 align="left">Q-8. What are the various formatting tags in HTML? </h2><hr>
<p align="left">There are many html tag that is used to modify the text appereance of your web page . </p>
<h4 align="left">1. Make headings using the &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; elements:</h4>
<p align="left">Every document has a heading at the top. Your headings might be different sizes. There are 6 levels of headings, with h1 being the biggest and most significant heading and h6 being the smallest. An illustration of the code for each headline size is provided here:</p>
<p align="left">
&lt;h1&gt; Level 1 Headline &lt;/h6&gt;<br>
&lt;h2&gt; Level 2 Headline &lt;/h2&gt;<br>
&lt;h3&gt; Level 3 Headline &lt;/h3&gt;<br>
&lt;h4&gt; Level 4 Headline &lt;/h4&gt;<br>
&lt;h5&gt; Level 5 Headline &lt;/h5&gt;<br>
&lt;h6&gt; Level 6 Headline &lt;/h6&gt;<br>
</p>
<h4 align="left">2. Establish a paragraph using the &lt;p&gt; element:</h4>
<p align="left">It is possible to divide your content into paragraphs using the  &lt;p&gt; element. As seen in the sample below, each paragraph of text should be separated by an initial  &lt;p&gt; and a closing &lt;/p&gt; tag.</p>
<p align="left">
&lt;p&gt; Here is a paragraph of text. &lt;/p&gt;<br>
&lt;p&gt;Here is a second paragraph of text. &lt;/p&gt;<br>
&lt;p&gt; Here is a third paragraph of text. &lt;/p&gt;<br>
</p>
<h4 align="left">3. Making Line Breaks With the &lt;"br&gt; Element</h4>
<p align="left">Everything that follows the &lt;br/&gt;element always begins on the next line. This tag is an example of an empty element because there is nothing in between the opening and closing tags.</p>
<p align="left">  There is a space between the letters br and the forward slash in the &lt;br/&gt; element. Older browsers will have problems rendering the line break if you don't include this space.</p>

<h4 align="left">4. Bold - &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;:</h4>
<p align="left">Like in a word processor, the text between the tags will be bold and stand out from the text surrounding it.</p>


<h4 align="left">5. Italic - &lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt; :</h4>
<p align="left">Italics display the text at a slight slant and operate similarly to a word processor.</p>


<h4 align="left">6. Underline - &lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;:</h4>
<p align="left">The same as underlining in a word processor, once more. HTML links are already underlined, thus there is no need for the additional tag.</p>


<h4 align="left">9. Source Code - &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt;:</h4>
<p align="left">The text is presented in a fixed-width typeface, similar to tt, and is frequently used to display source code. To display all tags on this website, I combined it with stylesheets.</p>


<h4 align="left">10. Typewriter Text - &lt;tt&gt; &lt;/tt&gt;:</h4>
<p align="left">The text has a fixed-width typeface, giving the impression that it was typewritten. For instance: The &lt;tt&gt; and &lt;/tt&gt; tags are used to format this text.</p>

<h4 align="left">11.Block Quote - &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;:</h4>
<p align="left">identifies a long quotation, which is presented with a margin to the left of the block quote that is very broad.</p>
<!--Question 9--> 

<h2 align="left">Q.9 How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing? </h2><hr>
<h4 align="left"><b>Ans-</b>Cellpadding :</h4>
<p align="left">The cellpadding attribute in HTML table formatting is used to specify the amount of space between a cell's edge and its content. Simply said, cellpadding is an attribute of the table tag (&lt;table&gt;) that determines how far the cell border and content are separated from one another.<br>

    The cellpadding property in HTML accepts values in pixels or percentages. Depending on the needs of the user, this value could be 0. The table tag's cellpadding attribute is supported in older versions of HTML, however it is not supported in HTML5.</p>
 <h4 align="left">Cellspacing :</h4>
 <p>In HTML, cell spacing is yet another attribute of the table tag. It regulates the separation between two neighboring cells. As a result, a site developer can quickly alter the distance between consecutive cells' edges. It is primarily used to make the table more readable.</p>

       HTML table? </h2><hr>
      <p align="left"> <b>Ans-</b>To club two or more rows and columns into single rows or columns, HTML's rowspan and colspan attributes can be used to accomplish this. In contrast to the colspan, which is used to combine the cells in a table's columns, the rowspan is used to combine or merge the number of cells in a row.</p>

<h2 align="left">Q-18. What is SVG? </h2><hr>

<p align="left"><b>Ans-</b>Scalable Vector Graphics, the abbreviation for the HTML SVG, is a type of graphic.<br><br>

A modular language called HTML SVG is used to describe visuals in XML. It describes mixed vector/raster and two-dimensional vector graphics in XML. The W3C has recommended it. XML text files contain the definitions of SVG images and their behaviour. An SVG image can therefore be created and edited as XML files, but generally speaking, drawing programs like inkspace are preferred to generate it.<br><br>

SVG is mostly used for vector diagrams, such as pie charts and 2-D graphs with an X, Y coordinate system.<br><br>

The root of an SVG fragment is specified by the svg> element. Every component and attribute in SVG files can be animated.</p>
